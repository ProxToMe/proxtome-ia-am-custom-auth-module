## Warning
**This code is not supported by ForgeRock and it is your responsibility to verify that the software is suitable and safe for use.**

## About

The **ProxToMe IA Custom Authentication Module** (referred to below as **PICAM**) allows ForgeRock AM users to integrate
in their instance the **ProxToMe Identity Assurance Service** (referred to below as **PIAS**).

By integrating the **PICAM** on the AM Server and the provided **Mobile SDK** in mobile apps, it is possible to add
the capability of assuring proximity of the app Users to specific **ProxToMe Dongle/s** (referred to below as **Dongle/s**) as means of Authorization to access a specific **Resource**.

The **PICAM** is compatible with **AM version 5.5** and above.

The **Mobile SDK** is compatible with **iOS version 9** and above.

# Installation Instruction

## PICAM

### Installation

To install the **PICAM**, you need to have a ForgeRock AM version 5.5 instance installed on your Server.
Follow the instructions here: [AM 5.5 Installation Guide](https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/am/5.5/install-guide/) to install AM on your Server.

Once you have your **AM** instance set up, follow this steps:

1. Download the archive at [$archive_url](https://archive.url).
2. Extract the archive on your Server.
3. Copy the **proxtome-ia-auth-module-*.jar** file to WEB-INF/lib/ where AM is deployed.
```
$ cp proxtome-ia-auth-module-*.jar /path/to/tomcat/webapps/openam/WEB-INF/lib/
```
4. Restart AM or the container in which it runs.
5. Log in to the AM console as an administrator, such as `amadmin`, and browse to `Realms > Top Level Realm > Authentication > Modules`. Click Add Module to create an instance of the **PICAM**. Name the module `ProxToMe`.
6. Click `Create`, and then configure the authentication module as appropriate. Click on `Save Changes`.

Now the **PICAM** is installed on your AM deployment.

### Configuration

1. Log in to the AM console as an administrator, such as `amadmin`, and browse to `Realms > Top Level Realm > Authentication > Chains`.
2. Click on `+ Add Chain`, then type the name of the Chain you want to use, for example `ProxToMeChain`.
3. Click on `Create`. Now click on the `+ Add a Module` button in the middle of the screen.
4. On the **Select Module** selection field, select the `ProxToMe` Module.
5. On the **Select Criteria** selection field, select `Required`.
6. Click on `OK`, then `Save Changes`.
7. Now browse to `Realms > Top Level Realm > Authorization > Policy Sets`.
8. Click on `+ New Policy Set`. Choose an **Id** and **Name** for your Policy Set, for example `ProxToMe` and `ProxToMe_Policy_Set`, and insert `URL` in the **Resource Types**.
9. Click on `Create`, then on the `+ Add a Policy` button. You should add a Policy for every URL you want to protect with the **PICAM**.
10. Insert the **Name** of the Resource you want to protect.
11. Select `URL` as **Resource Type**.
12. Insert the complete URL of the Resource you want to protect in the **Resources** field.
13. Click on `Create`. Now click on the pencil icon on the **Subjects** panel.
14. Select `Authenticated Users` in the **Type** panel. Click on **Save Changes**.
15. Click on the pencil icon on the **Actions** panel. Add all the actions (HTTP Methods) that the **PICAM** Authorization should allow the User to access. (Ex. `GET` and `POST`). Click on **Save Changes**.
16. Click on the pencil icon on the **Environments** panel. Click on **+ Add an Environment Condition**. Select `Authentication by Module Chain` as **Type** and input your Chain name as **Authenticate to Service**. In this case it would be `ProxToMeChain`.
17. Click on **Save Changes**.

Now the **PICAM** is configured, and you can test it by using the **Example App** provided with the **Mobile SDK**.

## Mobile SDK (iOS)

### Installation

To install the **Mobile SDK** in your app, you will need to follow this steps:
1. Download the archive at [$ios_archive_url](https://ios.archive.url).
2. Extract the archive on the development machine.
3. Open your app project in XCode.
4. Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire#installation) to install the **Alamofire** library in your app.
5. Open your **Target** and go in the **General** tab. Scroll to the **Embedded binaries** section.
6. Add `Alamofire.framework` and the `ProxToMeIA.framework` file included in the directory **Framework** to the **Embedded binaries** of your app.
7. In the app `Info.plist` file, add the `Privacy - Bluetooth Peripheral Usage Description` key, using as value `ProxToMe Identity Assurace`.

#### Tip
If you use **Objective C** instead of **Swift** in your project, you can follow the instructions [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/MixandMatch.html) and [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42693433/using-swift-framework-inside-objective-c-project) to include the `Alamofire.framework` and `ProxToMeIA.framework` in your project.

### Usage
To use the **Mobile SDK**, you have to import the `ProxToMe` class in your project.
```
import ProxToMeIA
```
You will then need to perform an Authentication process on your AM deployment to obtain a valid `authID`.
Then you have to initialize a `ProxToMe` object with an `options: [ProxToMeOptionsKey: Any]` dictionary.
The `options` dictionary shall always contain the four keys:
```
{
    ProxToMeOptionsKey.rssiTrigger: Decimal  // Contains the RSSI trigger for proximity to a Dongle. It should be in the range [0, -127]. Defaults to -62.
    ProxToMeOptionsKey.baseURL: String  // Contains the base URL of the AM Server to use.
    ProxToMeOptionsKey.authID: String  // Contains the auth ID received from AM after the authentication.
    ProxToMeOptionsKey.resourceURL: String  // Contains the Resource URL to require access to.
}
```
Usually, you will only need to set the `.baseURL`, `.authID` and `.resourceURL` keys.
For example:
```
let options: [ProxToMeOptionsKey: Any] = [
    .rssiTrigger: ProxToMe.defaultOptions[.rssiTrigger],
    .baseURL: "http://proxtome-am.cloudapp.net:8080/",
    .authID: "<...AM Auth ID...>",
    .resourceURL: "http://resource.com/device/{0}",
]
let proxtome = ProxToMe(options: options)  // ProxToMe Object initialization
```
will be a valid configuration, where:
- The `.rssiTrigger` value stays at `-62` as in the default configuration,
- The `.baseURL` value will be the URL of the example ProxToMe AM deployment,
- The `.authID` value is set with a dummy value,
- The `.resourceURL` value is set as `http://resource.com/device/{0}`. The `{0}` will be replaced with the Device Identifier returned by the **ProxToMe Service** when the proximity with the **Dongle** is confirmed.
You can omit the `{0}` and provide a valid URL if you don't need that parameter in the Resource URL you are protecting.

You will then need to start the scan for nearby **Dongles** by calling the `start` method on the `ProxToMe` object.
```
proxtome.start(callback: callback(name:tokenId:error:))
```
The `start` method takes a callback as parameter, that gets called when a proximity event with a **Dongle** is generated and verified by AM to authorize access to the **Resource** you requested.
The `callback` gets called with three parameters:
- `name: String?`, containing the nearby **Dongle** name, or `nil` if there was an error.
- `tokenId: String?`, containing the **tokenId** authorized by AM to access the Resource, or `nil` if there was an error.
- `error: ProxToMeError`, containing the error description in case of error, or `nil`.

You can use the `stop` method to stop the scan for nearby **Dongles**.

After you receive a valid `name` and `tokenId` in the `callback` function, you can use the `tokenId` to access the Resource with name `name` at the URL specified in the `options`.
To do that, you will need to set the `iPlanetDirectoryPro` header in your request to the received `tokenId`.

### Production build

The **Mobile SDK** is provided as a *Universal* framework, which means that the same `ProxToMeIA.framework` file will build both on Simulators and real iOS Devices.
Since Apple doesnâ€™t allow the application with unused architectures to the App Store, you need to follow this steps to build your app in production with the provided **Mobile SDK**.

1. Select the Project, Choose `Target > Project Name > Select Build Phases`.
2. Press `+` and then `New Run Script Phase`.
3. Name the Script as `Remove Unused Architectures Script`.
4. This script should always be placed below the **Embed Frameworks** phase.
5. Type this in the **Custom Run Scripts**:
```
FRAMEWORK="ProxToMeIA"
FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH="${BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}/${FRAMEWORKS_FOLDER_PATH}/$FRAMEWORK.framework/$FRAMEWORK"
EXTRACTED_ARCHS=()
for ARCH in $ARCHS
do
lipo -extract "$ARCH" "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH" -o "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH-$ARCH"
EXTRACTED_ARCHS+=("$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH-$ARCH")
done
lipo -o "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH-merged" -create "${EXTRACTED_ARCHS[@]}"
rm "${EXTRACTED_ARCHS[@]}"
rm "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH"
mv "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH-merged" "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH"
```
This run script removes the unused architectures only while pushing the Application to the App Store.


### Example app

In the **Mobile SDK** archive, you will find an example app in the directory **Example**.
The app implements the functions described above with a demo AM deployment and an example **Resource** URL protected by it.
